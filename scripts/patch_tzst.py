"""Rebrand .tzst assets in place: OLD -> NEW applicationId (same byte length).

The rootfs and driver archives embed /data/data/com.winlator/... absolute paths
(ELF PT_INTERP, ld.so.cache, locale-archive, configs, one absolute symlink
target). Because the replacement is exactly the same length, every offset-based
structure stays valid, so a plain byte substitution is safe.

The tar stream is rewritten member-by-member with tarfile so that symlink
linkname fields get patched with a correct header checksum, and so that no
symlink is ever materialized on NTFS. Compression is standard zstd frames
(level 19) readable by the on-device zstd-jni decoder.

Renaming the app means re-running this with OLD set to whatever the assets
currently carry. The 12-byte length is a hard requirement, not a convention:
PT_INTERP and the ELF string tables have no slack, so a longer name would need
every native component rebuilt from source.

  com.winlator (upstream) -> com.dgplayer (2026-08) -> com.retrople (2026-09)

For each archive the script:
  1. counts occurrences in the fully decompressed original stream (baseline)
  2. rewrites the tar, replacing OLD -> NEW in file contents and in
     name/linkname header fields (ASCII and UTF-16LE patterns)
  3. re-scans the produced archive: residual must be 0 and the number of
     replaced occurrences must equal the baseline
Only then is <file>.patched renamed over the original. Any mismatch aborts.
